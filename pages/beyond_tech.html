    <h2>The Developer's Path</h2>

  <p>
        I'm Ayanda â€” a 20-year-old aspiring full stack developer passionate about frontend and backend technologies.  
        I'm currently exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java, with a good foundation in Python.  
        Tech meets creativity in my world â€” especially when I blend programming with crochet-inspired projects!
