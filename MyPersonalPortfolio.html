            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Let me tell you a little about myself.
                I am a 20 turning 21 years old aspiring fullstack dev who just started learning frontend development,
                specifically HTML. I already am proficient in Python programming language and in the process of learning Java as well.
                That's not all though I'm a trained Cloud and network engineer as well who did training in CompTIA for IT and Systems and Network Support
                as well as MS365 Security and Administrator Expert at Newbridge Graduate Institute under Centurion Academy, just waiting to gather the funds to 
                write my international external exams for all these to obtain the necessary certifications. Right now
                I am currently attending at WeThinkCode and getting training to be a full stack developer. Well that's all from mr. Hope you enjoyed getting to know me.
